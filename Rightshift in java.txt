The >>> operator is the unsigned right bit-shift operator in Java. It effectively divides the operand by 2 to the power of the right operand, or just 2 here.

The difference between >> and >>> would only show up when shifting negative numbers. The >> operator shifts a 1 bit into the most significant bit if it was a 1, and the >>> shifts in a 0 regardless.
